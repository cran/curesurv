\arguments{
\item{z_ucured}{covariates matrix acting on survival function of uncured}

\item{z_pcured}{covariates matrix acting on cure proportion.}

\item{x}{the time arguments at which to calculate the cumulative excess hazard}

\item{theta}{the parameters of the cumulative excess hazard from a
Weibull distribution}

\item{sign_delta}{only used for mixture cure rate models to specify if the
effects or minus the effects of covariates acting on uncured survival to be
considered. Default will be sign_delta = "1". The alternative is
sign_delta = "-1".}
